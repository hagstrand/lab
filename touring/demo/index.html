		<div class="head2">the virtual tour guide for your smart phone</div>

		<p>This is a five-minute video shot from the inside of my car while driving through Encinitas.<br/>
		The audio you hear is coming from the iPhone clamped to the dashboard.</p>

		<p>Did you ever take a ride on a tour bus?  
		Where a guide with microphone points out interesting sites along your route 
		and tells colorful stories about the history and culture of the area?
		Well, now, anyone with an iPhone, Android, Blackberry or other smart phone 
		can have this virtual tour guide experience everywhere they drive.</p>

		<p>Once the driver starts this software app, it runs itself.
		It uses GPS geo-location so it knows where it is.
		It plays audio clips describing the surrounding landscape.
		Since it's all audio-based, the driver is hands-free, there are no distractions.</p>

		<p>Where does the content come from?  
		From everyone.  
		Anyone can record a story and contribute it.  
		Users can vote stories up and down.
		This is <b>social media</b> at its best.</p>

		<p>This is a new way to share knowledge.  
		People keep coming back again and again.</p>
		
		<p>And there are some very interesting opportunities for <b>local advertising</b>.
		Ask me about those.</p>
