enlightenment~No one who has lived even for a fleeting moment for something other than life in its conventional sense and has experienced the exaltation that this feeling produces can then renounce his new freedom so easily. ~Andre Breton
enlightenment~If I could define enlightenment briefly I would say it is the quiet acceptance of what is. ~Wayne Dyer
enlightenment~Enlightenment is a sublime word, if one goes back to its meaning; it means illumination of the spirit through truth, liberation from the shadows of error, or uncertainty, of doubt. Enlightenment is, in its deepest meaning, the transfiguration (Verkl ~Paul Leopold Haffner
enlightenment~I don't know Who -- or what -- put the question, I don't know when it was put. I don't even remember answering. But at some moment I did answer Yes to Someone --or Something --and from that hour I was certain that existence is meaningful and that, therefore, my life, in self-surrender, had a goal. ~Dag Hammarskjold
enlightenment~In this world, which is so plainly the antechamber of another, there are no happy men. The true division of humanity is between those who live in light and those who live in darkness. Our aim must be to diminish the number of the latter and increase the number of the former. That is why we demand education and knowledge. ~Victor Hugo
enlightenment~If one looks at all closely at the middle of our own century, the events that occupy us, our customs, our achievements and even our topics of conversation, it is difficult not to see that a very remarkable change in several respects has come into our ideas; a change which, by its rapidity, seems to us to foreshadow another still greater. Time alone will tell the aim, the nature and limits of this revolution, whose inconveniences and advantages our posterity will recognize better than we can. ~Jean le Rond d'Alembert
enlightenment~Enlightenment is man's emergence from his self-imposed nonage. Nonage is the inability to use one's understanding without another's guidance. This nonage is self-imposed if its cause lies not in lack of understanding but in indecision and lack of courage to use one's mind without another's guidance. Sapere Aude! Dare to Know! Have the courage to use your own understanding is therefore the motto of the Enlightenment. ~Immanuel Kant
enlightenment~The real meaning of enlightenment is to gaze with undimmed eyes on all darkness. ~Nikos Kazantzakis
enlightenment~The moment of truth, the sudden emergence of a new insight, is an act of intuition. Such intuitions give the appearance of miraculous flushes, or short-circuits of reasoning. In fact they may be likened to an immersed chain, of which only the beginning and the end are visible above the surface of consciousness. The diver vanishes at one end of the chain and comes up at the other end, guided by invisible links. ~Arthur Koestler
enlightenment~I do not comprehend those rules of conduct that make us so content with self and so cold to those we love. I detest prudence, I even hate (suffer me to say so) those duties of friendship which substitute propriety for interest, and circumspection for feeling. How shall I say it? I love the abandonment to impulse, I act from impulse only, and I love to madness that others do the same by me. ~Julie de Lespinasse, Letter to the Comte de Guibert
enlightenment~This notion is more clearly understood by asking What do I know?. ~Michel de Montaigne, Essays
enlightenment~How glorious, then, is the prospect, the reverse of all the past, which is now opening upon us, and upon the world. Government, we may now expect to see, not only in theory and in books but in actual practice, calculated for the general good, and taking no more upon it than the general good requires, leaving all men the enjoyment of as many of their natural rights as possible, and no more interfering with matters of religion, with men's notions concerning God, and a future state, than with philosophy, or medicine. ~Joseph Priestley, in a letter to Edmund Burke
enlightenment~Enlightenment must come little by little-otherwise it would overwhelm. ~Idries Shah
enlightenment~The light which puts out our eyes is darkness to us. Only that day dawns to which we are awake. There is more day to dawn. The sun is but a morning star. ~Henry David Thoreau
enlightenment~We see societies establishing themselves, nations forming themselves, which in turn dominate over other nations or become subject to them. Empires rise and fall; laws, forms of government, one succeeding another; the arts, the sciences, are discovered and are cultivated; sometimes retarded and sometimes accelerated in their progress, they pass from one region to another. Self-interest, ambition, vainglory, perpetually change the scene of the world, inundate the earth with blood. Yet in the midst of their ravages manners are gradually softened, the human mind takes enlightenment, separate nations draw nearer to each other, commerce and policy connect at last all parts of the globe, and the total mass of the human race, by the alternations of calm and agitation, of good conditions and of bad, marches always, although slowly, towards still higher perfection... ~Jacques Turgot
enlightenment~A man whose mind feels that it is captive would prefer to blind himself to the fact. But if he hates falsehood, he will not do so; and in that case he will have to suffer a lot. He will beat his head against the wall until he faints. He will come to again ~Simone Weil

peace~The real differences around the world today are not between Jews and Arabs; Protestants and Catholics; Muslims, Croats, and Serbs.

Clinton, 1997

peace~There is one armor that the world of men and women, as a world, has never yet put on.  The churches have long bungled with its fastenings, but the world has gone unfended, and few have been those in whose hands the mystical sword of the spirit has shone with daily use.  This armor, waiting to be worn, is the armor of brotherhood and sacrifice, the world of unselfishness, a conquering sword, with the power, where used, to unite the world in love.  And there are none who may not put it on.  ~M.A. DeWolfe Howe

peace~Right is more precious than peace.  ~Woodrow Wilson
peace~Maybe we should develop a Crayola bomb as our next secret weapon.  A happiness weapon.  A beauty bomb.  And every time a crisis developed, we would launch one.  It would explode high in the air - explode softly - and send thousands, millions, of little parachutes into the air.  Floating down to earth - boxes of Crayolas.  And we wouldn't go cheap, either - not little boxes of eight.  Boxes of sixty-four, with the sharpener built right in.  With silver and gold and copper, magenta and peach and lime, amber and umber and all the rest.  And people would smile and get a little funny look on their faces and cover the world with imagination.  ~Robert Fulghum

reason~Men are blind in their own cause. ~Heywood Broun
reason~As reason is a rebel to faith, so passion is a rebel to reason. ~Sir Thomas Browne
reason~Life, they urge, would be intolerable if men were to be guided in all they did by reason and reason only. Reason betrays men into the drawing of hard and fast lines, and to the defining by language -- language being like the sun, which rears and then scorches. Extremes are alone logical, but they are always absurd; the mean is illogical, but an illogical mean is better than the sheer absurdity of an extreme. There are no follies and no unreasonablenesses so great as those which can apparently be irrefragably defended by reason itself, and there is hardly an error into which men may not easily be led if they base their conduct upon reason only.
reason~Reason might very possibly abolish the double currency; it might even attack the personality of Hope and Justice. Besides, people have such a strong natural bias towards it that they will seek it for themselves and act upon it quite as much as or more than is good for them: there is no need of encouraging reason. With unreason the case is different. She is the natural complement of reason, without whose existence reason itself were non- existent.
reason~If, then, reason would be non-existent were there no such thing as unreason, surely it follows that the more unreason there is, the more reason there must be also? Hence the necessity for the development of unreason, even in the interests of reason herself. The Professors of Unreason deny that they undervalue reason: none can be more convinced than they are, that if the double currency cannot be rigorously deduced as a necessary consequence of human reason, the double currency should cease forthwith; but they say that it must be deduced from no narrow and exclusive view of reason which should deprive that admirable faculty of the one-half of its own existence. Unreason is a part of reason; it must therefore be allowed its full share in stating the initial conditions.

reason~Reason is a crutch for age, but youth is strong enough to walk alone. ~John Dryden
reason~A good cause can become bad if we fight for it with means that are indiscriminately murderous.

reason~Truth never damages a cause that is just. ~Mahatma Gandhi

reason~On life's vast ocean diversely we sail. Reasons the card, but passion the gale. ~Alexander Pope

acceptance~Today I know that I cannot control the ocean tides.  I can only go with the flow. . . . When I struggle and try to organize the Atlantic to my specifications, I sink.  If I flail and thrash and growl and grumble, I go under.  But, if I let go and float, I am borne aloft. ~Marie Stilkind

The fittest are those endowed with the qualifications for adaptation, the ability to accept the inevitable and conform to the unavoidable, to harmonize with existing or changing conditions. ~Dave.

acceptance~Everything in life that we really accept undergoes a change. So suffering must become love.  That is the mystery. ~Katherine Mansfield
acceptance~Our very first problem is to accept our present circumstances as they are, ourselves as we are, and the people about us as they are.

Every moment is a golden one for those who have the vision to recognize it as such. ~Henry Miller

I once refused to accept an inevitable situation with which I was confronted.  I played the fool and railed against it, and rebelled.  I turned my nights into hells of insomnia.  I brought upon myself everything I didn't want.  Finally, after a year of self-torture, I had to accept what I knew from the outset I couldn't possible alter. ~Dale Carnegie

courage~It takes courage to be the author of your life. When you are struggling through one of the difficult parts of turning your dreams into reality, you may wonder why you always get stuck with having to put up with so much fear and uncertainty. Why, you wonder, couldn't I feel more courageous, like those other people do? You don't feel courageous because courage is not an emotion. There is no such thing as feeling courageous.

courage~Courage brother, do not stumble, though thy path be dark as night: There is a star to guide the humble, Trust in God, and do the right. Let the road be dark and dreary and its end far out of sight. Face it bravely, strong or weary. Trust in God, and do the right. ~Norman Macleod
courage~Stand up to crises. Don't let them throw you! Fight to stay calm... even surmount the crisis completely and turn it into an opportunity. Refuse to renounce your self-image. No matter what happens, you must keep your good opinion of yourself. No matter what happens, you must hold your past successes in your imagination, ready for showing in the motion picture screen of your mind. No matter what happens, no matter what you lose, no matter what failures you must endure, you must keep faith in yourself. Then you can stand up to crises, with calm and courage, refusing to buckle; then you will not fall through the floor. You will be able to support yourself. ~Maxwell Maltz

courage~Never ask the Gods for life set free from grief, but ask for courage that endureth long. ~Menander
courage~Though the practice of chivalry fell even more sadly short of its theoretic standard than practice generally falls below theory, it remains one of the most precious monuments of the moral history of our race, as a remarkable instance of a concerted and organized attempt by a most disorganized and distracted society, to raise up and carry into practice a moral ideal greatly in advance of its social condition and institutions; so much so as to have been completely frustrated in the main object, yet never entirely inefficacious, and which has left a most sensible, and for the most part a highly valuable impress on the ideas and feelings of all subsequent times. ~John Stuart Mill

courage~There are times to cultivate and create, when you nurture your world and give birth to new ideas and ventures. There are times of flourishing and abundance, when life feels in full bloom, energized and expanding. And there are times of fruition, when things come to an end. They have reached their climax and must be harvested before they begin to fade. And finally of course, there are times that are cold, and cutting and empty, times when the spring of new beginnings seems like a distant dream. Those rhythms in life are natural events. They weave into one another as day follows night, bringing, not messages of hope and fear, but messages of how things are. ~Chogyam Trungpa

courage~It's not the size of the dog in the fight, it's the size of the fight in the dog. ~Mark Twain
courage~Courage is resistance to fear, mastery of fear--not absence of fear. Except a creature be part coward, it is not a compliment to say it is brave; it is merely a loose misapplication of the word. Consider the flea!--incomparably the bravest of all the creatures of God, if ignorance of fear were courage. Whether you are asleep or awake he will attack you, caring nothing for the fact that in bulk and strength you are to him as are the massed armies of the earth to a sucking child; he lives both day and night and all days and nights in the very lap of peril and the immediate presence of death, and yet is no more afraid than is the man who walks the streets of a city that was threatened by an earthquake ten centuries before. When we speak of Clive, Nelson, and Putnam as men who didn't know what fear was, we ought always to add the flea--and put him at the head of the procession. ~Mark Twain, Pudd'nhead Wilson, Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar

pride~There is one vice of which no man in the world is free; which every one in the world loathes when he sees it in someone else; and of which hardly any people, except Christians, ever imagine that they are guilty themselves. I have heard people admit that they are bad-tempered, or that they cannot keep their heads about girls or drink, or even that they are cowards. I do not think I have ever heard anyone who was not a Christian accuse himself of this vice. And at the same time I have very seldom met anyone, who was not a Christian, who showed the slightest mercy to it in others. There is no fault which makes a man more unpopular, and no fault which we are more unconscious of in ourselves. And the more we have it ourselves, the more we dislike it in others.
pride~The vice I am talking of is Pride or Self-Conceit: and the virtue opposite to it, in Christian morals, is called Humility. You may remember, when I was talking about sexual morality, I warned you that the centre of Christian morals did not lie there. Well, now, we have come to the centre. According to Christian teachers, the essential vice, the utmost evil, is Pride. Unchastity, anger, greed, drunkenness, and all that, are mere fleabites in comparison: it was through Pride that the devil became the devil: Pride leads to every other vice: it is the complete anti-God state of mind. ~C.S. Lewis, Mere Christianity. Chapter 8 in Book III: Christian Behaviour

pride~There is an awful lot of negative energy out there and some of it is directed at us by other people. But other people’s reactions and opinions are simply other people’s reactions and opinions. They are having their own experience and none of it has anything to do with you – it does not make you wrong, guilty, bad, unworthy, famous, loveable, or important. If you take it personally and take on the poison of another’s words, it becomes a very negative agreement you have with yourself. What anybody thinks about you, or says about you, is really about them. Not taking it personally allows you to be in relationship with anyone and not get trapped in their stuff. This agreement can also pertain to things that we take personally that cause us to go into upset. ~Don Miguel Ruiz, The Four Agreements agreement 2: Don

anger~Of the seven deadly sins, anger is possibly the most fun. To lick your wounds, to smack your lips over grievances long past, to roll over your tongue the prospect of bitter confrontations still to come, to savor to the last toothsome morsel both the pain you are given and the pain you are giving back- in many ways it is a feast fit for a king.

fear~Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that most frightens us.

There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It is not just in some of us, it is in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others. ~Marianne Williamson

grief~And brought me home, as all are brought, to lie

grief~For beauty born of beauty-- that remains. ~Madison Cawein, from To a Wind-Flower
grief~No one can keep his grieves in their prime; they use themselves up. ~E. M. Cioran
grief~There is immunity in reading, immunity in formal society, in office routine, in the company of old friends and in the giving of officious help to strangers, but there is no sanctuary in one bed from the memory of another. The past with its anguish will break through every defense-line of custom and habit; we must sleep and therefore we must dream. ~Cyril Connolly
grief~One often calms one's grief by recounting it. ~Pierre Corneille
grief~Grief is the agony of an instant, the indulgence of grief the blunder of a life. ~Benjamin Disraeli

grief~She was no longer wrestling with the grief, but could sit down with it as a lasting companion and make it a sharer in her thoughts. ~George Eliot
grief~The death of a dear friend, wife, brother, lover, which seemed nothing but privation, somewhat later assumes the aspect of a guide or genius; for it commonly operates revolutions in our way of life, terminates an epoch of infancy or of youth which was waiting to be closed, breaks up a wonted occupation, or a household, or style of living, and allows the formation of new ones more friendly to the growth of character. ~Ralph Waldo Emerson
grief~Time takes away the grief of men. ~Desiderius Erasmus
grief~If I be the first of us to die,
grief~Let grief not blacken long your sky.
grief~Be bold yet modest in your grieving.
grief~There is a change but not a leaving.
grief~For just as death is part of life,
grief~The dead live on forever in the living.
grief~And all the gathered riches of our journey,
grief~The moments shared, the mysteries explored,
grief~The steady layering of intimacy stored,
grief~The things that made us laugh or weep or sing,
grief~The joy of sunlit snow or first unfurling of the spring,
grief~The wordless language of look and touch,
grief~The knowing,
grief~Each giving and each taking,
grief~These are not flowers that fade,
grief~Nor trees that fall and crumble,
grief~Nor are they stone,
grief~For even stone cannot the wind and rain withstand
grief~And mighty mountain peaks in time reduce to sand.
grief~What we were, we are.
grief~What we had, we have.
grief~A conjoined past imperishably present.
grief~So when you walk the wood where once we walkedtogether
grief~And scan in vain the dappled bank beside you for my shadow,
grief~Or pause where we always did upon the hill to gaze across the land,
grief~And spotting something, reach by habit for my hand,
grief~And finding none, feel sorrow start to steal upon you,
grief~Be still.
grief~Close your eyes.
grief~Breathe.
grief~Listen for my footfall in your heart.
grief~I am not gone but merely walk within you. ~Nicholas Evans, from The Smoke Jumper copyright Nicholas Evans, 2001

grief~The record of a generous life runs like a vine around the memory of our dead, and every sweet, unselfish act is now a perfumed flower. ~Robert G. Ingersoll, from a eulogy Ingersoll wrote for his brother, Ebon, that was delivered in Washington, D.C. on May 31, 1879

grief~No one ever told me that grief felt so like fear. ~C.S. Lewis

grief~The only cure for grief is action. ~George Henry Lewis
grief~ ~Mary Ann Todd Lincoln, From letter to to her friend and neighbor Julia Ann Spriggs in Springfield, Ill., grieving over the death of Willie, the third Lincoln son, who died of typhoid resulting from contaminated drinking water from the Potomac river., May 29, 1862

grief~Don't order any black things. Rejoice in his memory; and be radiant: leave grief to the children. Wear violet and purple.

grief~The human heart dares not stay away too long from that which hurt it most. There is a return journey to anguish that few of us are released from making. ~Lillian Smith
grief~The grief of the keen is no personal complaint for the death of one woman over eighty years, but seems to contain the whole passionate rage that lurks somewhere in every native of the island. In this cry of pain the inner consciousness of the people seems to lay itself bare for an instant, and to reveal the mood of beings who feel their isolation in the face of a universe that wars on them with winds and seas. ~J. M. Synge
grief~What right have I to grieve, who have not ceased to wonder? ~Henry David Thoreau
grief~We feel at first as if some opportunities of kindness and sympathy were lost, but learn afterward that any pure grief is ample recompense for all. That is, if we are faithful; -- for a spent grief is but sympathy with the soul that disposes events, and is as natural as the resin of Arabian trees. -- Only nature has a right to grieve perpetually, for she only is innocent. Soon the ice will melt, and the blackbirds sing along the river which he frequented, as pleasantly as ever. The same everlasting serenity will appear in this face of God, and we will not be sorrowful, if he is not. ~Henry David Thoreau
grief~On the death of a friend, we should consider that the fates through confidence have devolved on us the task of a double living, that we have henceforth to fulfill the promise of our friend's life also, in our own, to the world. ~Henry David Thoreau
grief~A man's house burns down. The smoking wreckage represents only a ruined home that was dear through years of use and pleasant associations. By and by, as the days and weeks go on, first he misses this, then that, then the other thing. And when he casts about for it he finds that it was in that house. Always it is an essential -- there was but one of its kind. It cannot be replaced. It was in that house. It is irrevocably lost. It will be years before the tale of lost essentials is complete, and not till then can he truly know the magnitude of his disaster. ~Mark Twain

apathy~Mourn not the dead that in the cool earth lie Dust unto dust The calm, sweet earth that mothers all who die As all men must; Mourn not your captive comrades who must dwell Too strong to strive Within each steel-bound coffin of a cell, Buried alive; But rather mourn the apathetic throng The cowed and the meek Who see the world's great anguish and its wrong And dare not speak! ~Ralph Chaplin, Mourn Not the Dead Everybody in America is soft, and hates conflict. The cure for this, both in politics and social life, is the same -- hardihood. Give them raw truth. ~John Jay Chapman

apathy~Laws can embody standards; governments can enforce laws--but the final task is not a task for government. It is a task for each and every one of us. Every time we turn our heads the other way when we see the law flouted--when we tolerate what we know to be wrong--when we close our eyes and ears to the corrupt because we are too busy, or too frightened--when we fail to speak up and speak out--we strike a blow against freedom and decency and justice. ~Robert Francis Kennedy

apathy~The difference between our decadence and the Russians is that while theirs is brutal, ours is apathetic. ~James Thurber
apathy~I cannot help fearing that men may reach a point where they look on every new theory as a danger, every innovation as a toilsome trouble, every social advance as a first step toward revolution, and that they may absolutely refuse to move at all for fear of being carried off their feet. The prospect really does frighten me that they may finally become so engrossed in a cowardly love of immediate pleasures that their interest in their own future and in that of their descendants may vanish, and that they will prefer tamely to follow the course of their destiny rather than make a sudden energetic effort necessary to set things right. ~Alexis de Tocqueville
apathy~A Frenchman is self-assured because he regards himself personally both in mind and body as irresistibly attractive to men and women. An Englishman is self-assured as being a citizen of the best-organized state in the world and therefore, as an Englishman, always knows what he should do and knows that all he does as an Englishman is undoubtedly correct. An Italian is self-assured because he is excitable and easily forgets himself and other people. A Russian is self-assured just because he knows nothing and does not want to know anything, since he does not believe that anything can be known. The German's self-assurance is worst of all, stronger and more repulsive than any other, because he imagines that he knows the truth -- science -- which he himself has invented but which is for him the absolute truth. ~Leo Tolstoy
apathy~Only one enemy is worse than despair: indifference. In every area of human creativity, indifference is the enemy; indifference of evil is worse than evil, because it is also sterile. ~Elie Wiesel

shame~As a child grows in an environment in which his needs and longings for specialness and warm relatedness are consistently frustrated, he begins to turn away from his own needs in depression and shame. We can imagine the young child wondering, What is wrong with me that I get so little response from my mother? The two possible answers are I am too defective and unworthy of love, and there is something wrong with what I am asking for. In both cases, there is something wrong, either with the child himself or with his needs and desires.

Morrison, The Culture of Shame (Northvale, New Jersey:Jason Aronson,Inc. 1998), 66

shame~As blushing will sometimes make a whore pass for a virtuous woman, so modesty may make a fool seem a man of sense. ~Jonathan Swift
shame~Certain it is that scandal is good brisk talk, whereas praise of one's neighbor is by no means lively hearing.
