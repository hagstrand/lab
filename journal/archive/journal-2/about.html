		<h1>About Us</h1>

		<p>Aldous Huxley wrote a book titled Island.  He is better known for Brave New World, written about a dystopia.  Island is the antidote.  Island covers many of the same themes and technologies as Brave New World, but here they're used for good, to improve and uplift the race of man.</p>
		<p>On the Island are talking mynah birds, in the trees.  they say "Attention".  and "Here and now, boys."</p>
		<p>The islanders trained them to do this, to have reminders constantly throughout the day to focus one's attention on the here and now.</p>
		<p>Now, thanks to the miracle of smart phones, we can all have one of Huxley's Mynah Birds with us all the time.</p>
