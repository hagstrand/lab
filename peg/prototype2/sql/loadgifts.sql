A Judicious person, when given a project, will start working on it immediately in a step by step concrete/sequential manner.  A Perceptive person will start gathering information, many times on a subconscious level, while keeping the big picture in his head and seeing how all the pieces interact, usually putting things together before or at the deadline with more information than the Judicious person, who was limited to the information at hand as he went along plotting in a steady manner.  Many times, highly perceptive people will have several projects laid out at one time and can gather extra information by watching the overlap of information from one project to another and how the projects interact.  This may be very disrupting for somebody who does one thing at a time and cleans up before starting the next project.  This also means that you would probably do much better with a project table as opposed to a desk and that your room is a mess.

This also means that you are highly open to change and may use this in an abstract and imaginative way, as demonstrated in factors M and Q1 in the 16PF section.50.  You have the gift of being Spontaneous and being able to handle several projects at one time.  Perceptive people tend to be the opposite of Judicious people.  A Judicious person, when given a project, will start working on it immediately in a step by step concrete/sequential manner.  A Perceptive person will start gathering information, many times on a subconscious level, while keeping the big picture in his head and seeing how all the pieces interact, usually putting things together before or at the deadline with more information than the Judicious person, who was limited to the information at hand as he went along plotting in a steady manner.  Many times, highly perceptive people will have several projects laid out at one time and can gather extra information by watching the overlap of information from one project to another and how the projects interact.  This may be very disrupting for somebody who does one thing at a time and cleans up before starting the next project.  This also means that you would probably do much better with a project table as opposed to a desk and that your room is a mess.  All joking aside, a highly perceptive person will usually be very upset if someone changes or consolidates his piles that separate each project.  This also means that you are highly open to change and may use this in an abstract and imaginative way, as demonstrated in factors M and Q1 in the 16PF section.'

values (71, 'High You have a high gift of Creative Potential on both a personality level and in the structure of your intelligence.  This involves an exceptionally high bar in DSR, which is the last measure on the Structure of Intelligence test.  This is the ability to work in theoretical sciences.  This is the ability for divergent thinking, which is the ability to create new ideas from existing ones.  You also have a 70% bar in DMU, which measures your creativity with words and may imply writing talent.  Lastly, you are in the top 50% in DFU, which is the ability to be creative in spatial ideas that may imply artistic talent, design, or architecture.
