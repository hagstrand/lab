values (71, 'High I have a high gift of Creative Potential on both a personality level and in the structure of my intelligence.  This involves an exceptionally high bar in DSR, which is the last measure on the Structure of Intelligence test.  This is the ability to work in theoretical sciences.  This is the ability for divergent thinking, which is the ability to create new ideas from existing ones.  You also have a 70% bar in DMU, which measures my creativity with words and may imply writing talent.  Lastly, I am in the top 50% in DFU, which is the ability to be creative in spatial ideas that may imply artistic talent, design, or architecture.

In essence this makes you bilingual, and is an extremely rare gift that I have an opportunity to be able to bridge the gap between two very different personality types.
