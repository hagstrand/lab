				<h1>Amrita U Overview</h1>
				<p>With headquarters at Coimbatore and campuses at Amritapuri, Kochi, Bengaluru and Mysore, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham has emerged as one of the fastest growing institutions of higher learning in India. </p>
				<p>The Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham is a dream come true, a dream nursed by Mata Amritanandamayi to have a centre of excellence in learning for the benefit of all. Satguru Sri Mata Amritanandamayi Devi, Amma, one of the foremost humanitarian leaders in the world today, is the Chancellor of the University. In less than two decades, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham has blossomed into a multi-disciplinary, multicampus centre that offers over 150+ undergraduate, postgraduate and doctoral programmes in Engineering, Business, Medicine, Dentistry, Pharmacy, Nursing, Journalism, Biotechnology, Information Technology, Arts and Sciences, Health Sciences, Education, Microbiology, Hospital Management, Visual Media Studies, Communication, Social Work and Nanosciences and Ayurveda.</p>
				<p>Amrita University Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham has the unique distinction of  being the nation's first of its kind - fully interactive,  multidisciplinary, multi-media, virtual campus without  geographical limitations linking all its campuses. The  satellite network for education and research that links all the  campuses of the university has facilitated leading experts to  have academic interaction Live from a single Centre to  students, academicians and researchers at other campuses,  done through state-of-the-art e-learning studios in all  campuses. These studios are equipped with 130 seats for classroom instruction, 7 days a week using satellite link provided by Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO).</p>
				<p>Based on evaluation of all campuses and programs by a peer review committee, the university has been accredited by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) with an 'A' grade. Amrita has also been ranked in the Ivy League of Indian Universities along with Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), Mumbai etc. in a review of deemed universities by the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) of the Government of India. In a recent review of Deemed Universities by a high-power committee of reputed academicians, popularly known as the Tandon Committee, set up by the Ministry of Human Resources Development, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham was placed in Category 1. In Tamil Nadu, besides Amrita, only the Chennai Mathematical Institute, a Deemed University, was given this recognition. </p>
				<p>Amrita began as a School of Engineering in 1994 in an obscure village, Ettimadai, located at the foothills of Bouluvanpatty Ranges of the Western Ghats in Coimbatore District of Tamil Nadu. It was indeed a modest beginning with just 120 students and 13 faculty members. </p>
				<p>Today, Amrita has a student population of over 16000 and faculty strength of 2000, including over 300 faculty members with Ph.D. /DM qualifications. The university's faculty-student ratio of 1:8 is one of the best among all institutions of higher learning in India. </p>
				<p>The university encompasses a total land area of over 900 acres with building complexes occupying around 8 million square feet. Right from the outset, the university has had a multi-disciplinary and multi-campus character. </p>
				<p>In 2003, Amrita became the youngest group of higher educational institutions in India to be conferred the "University" status under "Section 3 of UGC Act 1956" by the Government of India. Research is a highly significant activity at the university. Many centres of excellence have been started in cutting-edge areas like Nanosciences, Biomedical Engineering, Environmental Sciences, Molecular Medicine, Wireless Sensor Networks, Computational Engineering & Networking, Cyber Security, Biostatistics, Cancer etc with the support of major national laboratories, industry leaders and agencies like TIFAC, DBT, DST, ICMR, ISRO, DRDO, DBT, DIT, DRDO, BARC, Microsoft, Hewlett Packard, Media Lab Asia, Infosys, MDS Pharma, Biocon etc. Amrita is also a partner in the Ministry of Human Resource Developments National Mission for Education using ICT for various projects in haptics, virtual labs, Educational Resource Planning and interactive e-learning systems. </p>
				<p>Amrita faculty members have published 200 books and 2000 papers in reputed international and national journals in the past eight years. Amrita has attracted grants from various governmental and private funding agencies to the tune of more than Rs.100 crores in the past eight years. Amrita has also invested over Rs.75 crores for research promotion and building of research facilities and centres. Amrita has bagged 40 major patents and inventions in the past few years which include Adaptive and Automatic Insulin Pump, Wireless Telematics, Virtual Private Network (VPN), Amrita Hospital Information System (AHIS) etc. Plans are afoot to manufacture the Automatic Insulin Pump commercially, which will be affordable for the poor at one-third of the cost of similar such devices. </p>
				<p>Amrita also hosts the one of the largest satellite E-learning and Telemedicine networks in India. AIMS The 1450-bed super-specialty hospital, Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences (AIMS) at the Health Sciences campus in Kochi, is a unique establishment offering subsidized and free treatment, totaling over Rs. 25 crores per year, to poor and needy patients. The extensive infrastructure of AIMS comprises of 60 departments, 25 modern operating theatres, 210 well-equipped intensive care beds, a reference diagnostic clinical laboratory, including advanced molecular, biology and cytogenetics labs, a state-of-the-art diagnostic imaging centre and research facilities. Patient care is enhanced by a fully computerized and networked hospital information system and a fully digitized radiology department. Annual patient turnover exceeds 450,000 outpatients and nearly 40,000 inpatients. </p>
				<p>The super-specialty hospital AIMS also offers telemedicine services to various remote parts of the country and Africa through the ISRO satellite link. AIMS hospital is accredited with ISO 9002-2000, NABH and NABL. Amrita is the only University Teaching Hospital in India to secure NABH accreditation. </p>
				<p>Yoga Class All students have ample opportunity for orientation in yoga, meditation and cultural education. Integrated Amrita Meditation (IAM) technique helps them to achieve holistic development of mind and body. </p>
				<p>Students are at the forefront of the Amala Bharatam Campaign (ABC) initiated by Chancellor Amma to bring cleanliness to the country and restore the purity of Mother India. In the past, they have demonstrated their commitment to engaging with society and the community by participating in disaster relief and rehabilitation activities after the Gujarat earthquake in 2001, Tsunami relief operations in Tamil Nadu and Kerala in 2005-2006, flood relief operations in Bihar in 2009 and Karnataka in 2010. </p>
				<p>Several research initiatives and collaborative programs are ongoing with US and European Universities. A Memorandum of Understanding was signed in 2005 by Amrita and various top US Universities including Harvard, Purdue, State University of New York (SUNY) at Buffalo, Yale, Princeton, Columbia, Berkeley, Michigan, Maryland and University of California. This landmark agreement was inked to facilitate faculty and student exchange, collaborative research and educational programs, cross-continental projects and other such learning activities.</p>
				<p>The agreement was signed on July 20, 2005 during the visit of the Honorable Prime Minister of India, Dr. Manmohan Singh, to Washington DC. In December that year, the then President of India, Dr. Abdul Kalam formally launched the Indo-US Inter-University Collaborative Initiative in Higher Education and Research using ISRO's satellite network, EDUSAT. Since then, hundreds of distinguished lectures and short-term courses have been beamed to students as part of this initiative. The network has also facilitated the initiation of major research projects and full-term courses at Amrita, with active participation from faculty of the US universities. </p>
				<p>Amrita has developed a unique E-Learning system, A-VIEW (Amrita Virtual Interactive e-Learning World), which is cutting-edge video conferencing software, customized explicitly for Universities. AVIEW uses a network of four high-resolution displays to provide an immersive learning experience that almost equals being in an actual classroom. The Government of India has decided to deploy this platform in the thousands of colleges all over the country, thus attempting to overcome the shortage of highly qualified teachers. Now students anywhere can attend the lectures of the best teachers in the country over the Internet using A-VIEW. </p>
				<p>Winsoc Amrita has successfully completed an Indo-European WINSOC Project, Amrita WNA which is recognized worldwide today for its deployment of the first-ever Wireless Sensor Network System for predicting landslides. The system uses wireless sensor technology to provide advance warning of an impending landslide disaster, facilitating evacuation and disaster management. The Government of India has shown interest to deploy this system in all landslide prone areas including the Himalayas and the Konkan Region. Nine European universities and research centers collaborated with Amrita on this project.	</p>
				<p>Extensive faculty and student exchange programs through Erasmus Mundus of the European Commission delegated over one hundred faculty, students and research scholars from Amrita to various European universities in United Kingdom, Ireland, Italy, Sweden, Germany, Finland, Bulgaria and Netherlands such as University of Milan, University of Twente, Technical University of Munich, University of Groningen and Uppsala University for academic and research assignments. </p>
				<p>Today various projects in Virtual Labs, Haptics, Natural Language Processing, Educational Resource Planning and Interactive E-Learning Systems are ongoing at Amrita, funded by the Ministry of Human Resources Development as part of the National Mission for Education using ICT.</p>

				<h1>Amma on Education</h1>
				<p>There are two types of education: education for a living and education for life. When we study in college, striving to become a doctor, a lawyer, or an engineer, that is education for a living. But education for life requires an understanding of the essential principles of spirituality; it is about gaining a deeper understanding of the world, our minds, our emotions, and ourselves.</p>
				<p>We all know that the real goal of education is not to create people who understand only the language of technology; the main purpose of education should be to impart a culture of the heart, a culture based on spiritual values. Viewing religion only outwardly creates more and more division. We need to see and understand the inside, the essence of religion, from a spiritual perspective. Only then will the sense of division come to an end. Where there is division, there cannot be any real spritual experience; and where there is true spritual experience, there will be no division - only unity and love. </p>
				<p>Love and compassion are the very essence of all religions. What, then, is the need for us to compete?. Love is our true essence. Love has no limitations such as religion, race, nationality, or caste. We are all beads strung together on the same thread of love.</p>
				<p>To awaken this unity and to spread the love that is our inherent nature to others - this is the true aim of human life. Indeed, love is the only religion that can help humanity rise to great and glorious heights. And love should be the one thread on which all religions and philosophies are strung together. The beauty of society lies in the unity of our hearts.</p>
				<p>Long ago, everyone stayed at the residence of the Guru throughout the period of their education. You might have heard about the Guru-disciple relationship that existed. Students from all different castes and backgrounds used to come and stay at the gurukula. The period of education would last for at least 12 years. The system was entirely different in those days. It was not at all like modern schools and colleges As a result, students came to know the nature of life, how to live and how to behave in the world. Because of that, they were blissful. They became strong-minded and could overcome easily any obstacle. </p>
				<p>During that time, the type of education which existed was gurukula vidyabhyasa. Even at a young age, obedience to parents and the Guru would be taught. After spending time in the gurukula, the purpose of life and the reason for taking birth would be understood.</p>
				<p>Human intellect has taken humanity to great heights in the field of science. There was a time when people believed that much of which science has attained today was absolutely impossible. They never even dreamed that human beings could go to the moon or that people, while sitting in their homes looking at a small machine called a TV, could view events occurring in another part of the world. Think of the once unimaginable and unbelievable developments of modern science that are now taken for granted. From where do all these things come? What is behind all these wonderful inventions? They are achievements of the human intellect. </p>
				<p>These inventions and achievements are clear-cut proofs of the tremendous power inherent in the human mind that is directed toward scientific discovery. And yet, the power of a scientist's intellect is only an infinitesimal portion of the inherent power in the human mind. The power of human mind is immeasurable. </p>
				<p>This infinite power is in all human beings. If a person really wants to do something, nothing is impossible. Nothing can enslave him, overpower him or control him if he is courageous enough to dive deep into his own mind, his own consciousness. He can contact the very fundamental basis of the source of power</p>
				<p>When there is only respect and no love, fear is bound to occur. There is an aspect of fear in respect. For example, the schoolteacher asks the student to learn a poem by heart before he comes to class the next day. The poor student isn't interested in poetry. He'd rather play sports and watch TV. The student respects his teacher, but he doesn't love him. He feels that the teacher is forcing something on him that he doesn't like. He dare not say no to this teacher, because he is afraid of him and also afraid of his parents and of the punishment he may get if he doesn't obey. So he practices repeating the poem several times and memorizes it. This is not real learning. No real learning is possible as long as there is fear. This form of learning will never help the student to attain any true knowledge, because it isn't done with the heart. Out of respect and fear of his teacher, the student learns like a parrot without imbibing the meaning. But the student's heart is closed. Fear closes the heart and there is then every probability that the student will forget what he has learned. Only if the heart is open, can he really learn. Otherwise, the process of learning and all his actions will be mechanical. </p>
				<p>You feed and store information into a computer. Whenever you want to use this information, you simply press a few keys and it appears before you. But, if you happen to press the wrong button by mistake, that's it! ---all the data you have saved is gone. The screen goes blank. </p>
				<p>The computer can only obey whatever command it is given. The computer is not intelligent and it cannot feel anything, because it's only a machine invented by the human intellect. A human being can become almost like a breathing, moving computer, if he doesn't have a loving and compassionate heart. Respect that is devoid of love and based on fear will close your heart and turn you into a human machine. If you obey your teacher or your parents only out of fear and respect, it is no more than feeding information into a computer. It can go blank at any time, because there is no love to hold and support it.</p>
				<p>If you want to learn your lessons well, relaxation is the best method. It will keep your intellect clear, your memory power will increase tremendously, and you will not exhaust your energy by repeating a lesson a hundred times in order to memorize it. When you are deeply relaxed, you need only read the lesson one and you will know it forever.</p>
				<p>When you relax, you forget everything. A space is created and your mind becomes empty. In that mood of emptiness, if you focus all your energy on something of your choice, the whole subject just enters into you. At that moment your whole being is wide open. Every atom, every cell of your body is so receptive that you can just swallow the whole subject and digest it. This is the method that the rishis used in the education of their disciples. They made their disciples forget everything and relax. In that atmosphere of love and openness all their previous conditioning was forgotten.</p>
				<p>We need to teach students the art of relaxation--how to be at ease. If they don't feel relaxed, how can they learn? Without relaxation, no real learning is possible. This is the first lesson that clearly needs to be understood. It's very important that parents should understand this before they ask their children to do something. Spiritual practices such as meditation, repetition of a mantra, and singing bhajans are different methods which are meant to relax the mind so that you can always be open like a freshly blossomed flower.</p>
				<p>Only through relaxed study can knowledge be retained. A study undertaken with stress and strain, without any relaxed, restful moments for the body, mind or intellect, cannot be successful. In fact, it is relaxation that provides the clarity of vision and the energy necessary to learn and retain any real knowledge. The knowledge gathered in this way remains fresh forever, irrespective of your age. Whatever learning one does mechanically, under stressful and strenuous circumstances without any relaxation, will not help in the overall development of a person. Only someone who has gathered knowledge with a peaceful mind can really put that knowledge into practice and become a master in his field.</p>
				<p>A person who knows how to relax continues to learn new things. Throughout his life, his thirst for knowledge will remain ever fresh. He feels no tension; he is relaxed, and he therefore keeps on gathering knowledge, which he actually puts into practice. For example, he not only studies about space, he invents new methods, new techniques and equipment with which to explore the subject. He not only learns about the undersea world, he dives deep into the water to discover what is there. His curiosity is inexhaustible. Even though he has an unquenchable thirst to learn and to know, he is always relaxed, and this relaxed mood gives him the strength and vitality to absorb more knowledge and to put it into practice through his experiments. </p>
				<p>There are poets, painters, musicians and scientists who spend a lot of time in solitude, contemplating and relaxing. They withdraw from the noisy world and go into seclusion. While sitting in a fully relaxed mood, they withdraw from the mind and its thoughts. They will sometimes slip into a deep trancelike state, and as they come out of that state they are able to create a great masterpiece.</p>
				<p>Creating fear and respect in order to teach obedience cannot be called disciplining, but it is true that constructive disciplining takes place when love is allowed to blossom. If love is absent, any reverence or respect will be based on fear. A loving relationship, however, will open up your heart and enable you to express yourself fully in whichever way you choose. Love brings you closer together, and in that closeness, there is no lack of discipline at all. Out of that love, which comes from proper understanding, a natural and genuine respect will be born. In other words, once a strong bond of love is established between the teacher and student, or parent and child, disciplining can be done easily, without causing any hurt feelings in the one who is being disciplined. This loving closeness, this meeting of hearts, is vitally important in the relationship between teacher and student, or parent and child. But for this closeness to happen, one must be patient and forgiving. </p>
				<p>Parents should instill good qualities and good conduct in their children, and this means instructing them in spiritual matters. They should tell their children stories that depict moral principles and train them to do japa and meditation. Through sadhana, intelligence and memory will improve, as well as conduct.</p>
				<p>Undoubtedly, self-discipline is needed during the present age. Each one of us must become aware of the urgency for self-discipline. It is not simply a need, but an urgent necessity which must be practiced by every individual of the country. Instead of polishing and beautifying the body and the world outside, while the mind remains a mess, we should do all this polishing and beautifying inside. Stop becoming tense about external situations. </p>
				<p>Once the inside of a person is clean, then the outer circumstances automatically become all right. Stop giving too much importance to external objects.</p>
				<p>There are many masters around the world who have attained the ultimate state. If they could do it, you too should be able to do it. Why have doubts? Try. Doubting is learned; you have learned to doubt. You have never learned to believe, to have faith. Doubt is your number one enemy. Faith is your best friend. Have faith and put forth effort. You will see the outcome. </p>
				<p>A medical student is not a doctor. It takes years of concentrated study and preparations to become a good doctor. But during the period when he is still an intern, we might call him a doctor even though he hasn't yet received his degree. Why? Because it is the goal he will reach at the end of his studies. Whatever he does is done as a preparation towards that goal. His aim is to be a doctor; he constantly remembers this and makes every effort to attain that final goal. He refrains from any action or situation that could create an obstacle on his path.</p>
