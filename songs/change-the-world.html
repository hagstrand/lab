       Change the World
       Eric Clapton (from the movie Phenomenon)
       (transcribed by Andrew P. Citron citron@vnet.ibm.com and
        Merri Robinson)

<span>E</span> <span>F#m</span> <span>G</span>     <span>G</span> <span>F#</span> <span>E</span>     <span>E</span> <span>F#m</span> <span>G</span>     <span>G</span>  <span>F#m</span>  <span>B7sus4</span>

<span>E</span>          <span>E6</span>        <span>E7</span>     <span>E7</span>       <span>E6</span>       <span>E</span>
If I could reach the stars, pull one down for you.
<span>E</span>       <span>E6</span>    <span>E7</span>     <span>E7</span>           <span>E6</span>      <span>E</span>
Shinin' on my heart, so you could see the truth.
<span>A</span>         <span>A6</span>          <span>A7</span>      <span>A7</span>      <span>A6</span>    <span>A</span>
That this love I have inside, is everything it seems
<span>E</span>       <span>E6</span>    <span>E7</span>    <span>E7</span>       <span>E6</span>    <span>Ab7</span>
But for now I find, its only in my dreams

          <span>F#m7</span> <span>Ab7</span>    <span>C#m</span>     <span>F#m</span>            <span>Ab7</span>              <span>C#m</span>
That I can change  the world.  I would be the sunlight in your universe
<span>F#m7</span>                <span>Ab7</span>             <span>C#m7</span> <span>Cm7</span>   <span>Bm7</span>
You would think our love was really some-thing good

     <span>A</span>    <span>E/G#</span>   <span>Abm</span> <span>Gm</span> <span>F#m</span>(6 beats) <span>E</span>
Baby if I could, change......       the world

<span>E</span>   <span>E6</span>   <span>E7</span>   <span>E7</span>  <span>E6</span>   <span>E</span>

<span>E</span>    <span>E6</span>       <span>E7</span>     <span>E7</span>   <span>E6</span>    <span>E</span>
If I could be king,  even for a day.
<span>E</span>            <span>E6</span>    <span>E7</span>      <span>E7</span>          <span>E6</span>       <span>E</span>
I'd take you as my queen.  I'd have it no other way.
<span>Ab</span> <span>A</span>       <span>A6</span>         <span>A7</span>         <span>A7</span>      <span>A6</span>      <span>A</span>
   And our love would rule, this kingdom we have made.
<span>E</span>             <span>E6</span>   <span>E7</span>    <span>E7</span>     <span>E6</span>      <span>Ab7</span>
Till then I'd be a fool, wishin for the day...

          <span>F#m</span> <span>Ab7</span>    <span>C#m</span>     <span>F#m</span>            <span>Ab7</span>              <span>C#m</span>
That I can change the world.  I would be the sunlight in your universe
<span>F#m</span>                 <span>Ab7</span>             <span>C#m7</span> <span>Cm7</span>   <span>Bm7</span>
You would think our love was really some-thing good
     <span>A7</span>   <span>E/G#</span>   <span>Abm</span> <span>Gm</span> <span>F#m</span>(2 Beats)<span>E</span>(4 beats)
Baby if I could, change         the world
     <span>A7</span>   <span>E/G#</span>   <span>Abm</span> <span>Gm</span> <span>F#m</span>  (6beats) <span>E</span>

Note that the 6th chords are actually 6/11 chords.  The
chords are not played with the 6th or 7th on top.  Also, most
of the minor chords are actually minor 7th chords.  The intro
really is E E6 E7 chords with E F# G in the bass.
